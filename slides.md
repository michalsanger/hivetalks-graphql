## Tips and tricks

Hi my name is...

^
No theory, just a practical stuff

---

# Why?

- Easy on-boarding
- Developer experience
- Handy tools
- Bright future

^
Don't use new technology because of this!

^
Use it because it solves problem. Fetching data for chatbot was a problem

- So you are attracted by a GraphQL
- But what about the current setup?

---

# Wild Wild REST

^
REST works, but sucks during the time

^
Let's see Kiwi.com as example

---

# Wild Wild REST

- docs.skypickerpublicapi.apiary.io
- docs.skypickerbookingapi1.apiary.io
- docs.locations10.apiary.io

^
Plus some private and undocumented

---

# Wild Wild REST

- WTF factor
- Docs get old
- Versioning
- Over fetching

^
More endpoints have to be called for simple usecase

^
Optimizations on web (bundling, CDN) must be done again on mobile. If lucky

---
# How

- Proxy REST API
- Serverless

This is cool, but best we did was Wish Driven Development

---

# Wish driven development

^
REST is static, GQL schema gives options. Combine what's available!

^
Entities + relations + queries + fantasy

^
Easy experiments in product. Optimize once. Measure!

---

# Tools

---

# GraphiQL

---

^
- Build from schema, always fresh
- Something like API console

Technology is easy, people are hard :-)

Subscriptions are cool, make it scalable is a chalange

^
Static analyze the query, refuse to execute if too much data is requested
